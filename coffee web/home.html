      What is House Blend Coffee meaning? House Blend: The approach that many
      successful coffee shops use is to start with a “house blend.” It's
      essentially a straight-forward “all day drinker” that is good on it's own
      and pairs well with the milk and sugar many customers will inevitably add
      <br />
      The degree to which a coffee bean is roasted is one of the most important
      factors that determine the taste of the coffee. Unroasted beans (green in
      color) are put into a roaster and exposed to a high level of heat. When
      the bean “cracks,” it loses its outer coating and releases the flavor of
      the bean. The longer the bean roasts, the darker and stronger the bean
      becomes. When the roasting is complete, the beans can be blended and
      ground to create distinct flavors and brews.

    <img src="./hpude blend.webp" width="20%" alt="House Blend Coffee" />
    <p>
      Colombian coffee is generally a bit weaker than other coffees. Colombian
      coffee uses Arabica, generally accepted as the higher-quality coffee bean.
      The Arabica bean is a bit lighter than the Robusta, so your cup of
      Colombian coffee will typically be a bit weaker than a cup made from
      Robusta.
      <br />
      What makes Colombian coffee unique? Colombian coffee has unique flavor due
      to its growing conditions and processing methods. High-quality Arabica
      beans are grown at high altitudes. They are then processed naturally, by
      hand, on small farms.
